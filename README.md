# Duplicate Management
* Matching rule - The matching criteria to identify duplicate records.
  * Salesforce comes with three standard matching rules: 
    * one for business accounts; 
    * one for contacts and leads, 
    * and another for person accounts. 
* Duplicate rule - Depending on how you configure Duplicate Management, sales reps see an alert that theyâ€™re about to create a duplicate. Or your reps are blocked from creating the duplicate altogether.
